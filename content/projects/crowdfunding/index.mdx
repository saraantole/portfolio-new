CrowdCoin is a crowdfunding platform powered by Ethereum Blockchain, living on Ropsten testnet.
The frontend was made with Next.js and interacts with the smart contracts written in Solidity, through Web.js.
This dApp allows people with a project idea to create a campaign and be funded by contributors.
Every time the creator of the campaign needs to use some amount of the campaign balance, he/she will open a spending request
that must be authorized by the majority of the contributors in order to be executed.
