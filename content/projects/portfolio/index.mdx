For my portfolio, I wanted to create a website that would show my personality at best ( ...or at least I tried to). As you can see, I'm a big fan of minimalist design and dark/light mode. Also, I bet on Jamstack architecture so my personal site couldn't help but be done with Gatsby. I chose a starter and then customized and expanded the already present features to my liking.
