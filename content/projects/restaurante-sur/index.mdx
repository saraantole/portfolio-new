The main goal of this web app is to create an official website that respects the voice of the brand where customers can not only browse the menu offered, but also be able to contact the restaurant by phone and get the coordinates of the location.
Being a local business, I chose to use Gatsby, which is perfect for SEO.

Considering that the target user of the page is not a corporation, I gave a lot of importance to responsiveness and found it a plus to turn the app into PWA so that the recurring customer who is on the street and wants to consult the site can do so offline as well.
Since the store is located in an area frequently visited by foreign tourists, the site has been localized in Spanish and English.

Thanks to this website, the company was able to attract new local and foreign clients, expanding its customer base by 30% during the pandemic. The website is getting 20,000 visitors per month on average.
