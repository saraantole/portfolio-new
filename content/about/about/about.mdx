## My background

My passion for programming wasn't at first sight.
Before starting my journey into the tech world, I graduated in Business and Tourism Translation.
Once I finished university, I got into online marketing which leaded me to take my first steps into the digital industry.
This zigzag between different fields helped me open up to new horizons and acquire a skill set that goes beyond web development.

## My experience

After working as a freelancer, I was hired as Lead Fullstack Developer for a tickets sale startup. My responsibilities included choosing the right architecture for the whole project and interfaces (the main tickets platform, a web app for ticket takers to scan tickets at the events, and a back-office interface for creating the events landing pages), choosing and integrating the right third-party services for the project needs, coding, integrating, and testing the different applications and the general workflow.

## My mission

When I started out, I got into technology because it allowed me to create meaningful products for users around the world.
Now, thanks to Blockchain, developers are not only helping to provide value for the present but have the opportunity to create a new decentralized and more democratic world for the future.
Isn't that enough of a mission?

## My interests

I like to understand the why of things, the mechanism behind them.
And I like to see how an idea materializes and becomes something useful to the world.
After exploring UI/UX Design, Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and getting my hands dirty with Fullstack development, I focused on Fullstack Blockchain/DApps Development.
Coding aside, I love traveling, nature walks, and desserts.
