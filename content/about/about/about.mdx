## My background
My passion for programming wasn't at first sight. Before starting my journey into the tech world, I graduated in Business and Tourism Translation. Once I finished university, I got into online marketing which leaded me to take my first steps into the digital industry. This zigzag between different fields helped me open up to new horizons and acquire a skills set that goes beyond web development.

## My mission
I have the belief that nowadays every web app should not only provide an information or service in a secure way but also deliver a pleasant experience to the user. Therefore, I always seek to combine usability, security and performance.

## My interests
I like to understand the why of things, the mechanism behind them. And I like to see how an idea materializes and becomes something useful to the world. So far, I've tried my hand at both frontend and backend development and UX/UI design. I'm currently in the process of decrypting cybersecurity. Next step: machine learning. Coding aside, I love traveling, nature walking and desserts.
